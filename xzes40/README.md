# XZES40 Project

These projects include:

- `transformer`

## Directory Structure

Each project is organized according to a ['better than nothing' standardized structure][cpp-project].
This looks as follows:

```
project/
|-- bin
|   `-- generated binaries (a.out)
|-- doc
|   `-- documentation (*.txt, *.md, *.rst)
|-- include
|   `-- headers (*.h, *.hpp)
|-- lib
|   `-- external dependencies (*.h, *.hpp, *.c, *.cpp)
|-- Makefile
|-- src
|   `-- code (*.c, *.cpp)
`-- test
    `-- unit tests (*.c, *.cpp)
```
