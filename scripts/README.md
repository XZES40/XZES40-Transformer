# Scripts

This directory includes scripts used for development that didn't really fit with a specific part of a project **or** had multiple purposes.

The scripts are exclusively written in Bash and focus on operatins.

The `ci` directory includes scripts intended for Continuous Integration.
If you are interested in how a componet is used, see if it has a script associated with that.

The CI system we intended to use heavily was TravisCI.
Most of the `ci` scripts do not get used except for the one that builds the software.
That said most of the scripts are mostly accurate, just not robust enough for an automation build system.
