The OSU/ASF Capstone Project is to use group "staff" and umask 002.

I have performed numerous system tests for propogating UMASK with
limited success.  The best workaround is to edit the .bashrc files
and supply the umask command therein.

DEBIAN PLATFORM -- Apply the umask edits to the following files.

   /root/.bashrc   -- allows sudo scripts to work with umask 002
   $HOME/.bashrc   -- allows user scripts to work with umask 002

DEBIAN - UMASK ISSUES -- Retain the Defaults -- The following do not work.
Configurations of UMASK that DO NOT WORK -- Retain the Defaults

-- for login authentication

   /etc/login.defs
     UMASK 002

-- for login authentication using pam to unlock the umask feature

   /etc/pam.d/common-session
     session optional     pam_umask.so

-- standard bourne shell (sh) profile - ignored when using xfce

   /etc/profile
     umask 002
