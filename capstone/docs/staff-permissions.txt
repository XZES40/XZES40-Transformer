OSU Capstone Project / Debian

The /data/* directories are associated with the "staff" group
and should be granted full "staff" access, recommending a umask 002
instead of default umask 022 permissions.

The /usr/local/* directories in Debian are associated with the "staff"
group and should be granted full "staff" access, recommending a
umask 002 instead of default umask 022 permissions.

Permissions compatibility with "staff"

The Debian project is moving toward /usr/local/ directory trees having
"staff" group permissions.

Group passwords are kept in file /etc/gshadow and administered by the
"gpasswd" program.

You can temporarily change your group membership by invoking the
"newgrp groupname" command.

Default is to require a group password, but no passwords are valid.
If an empty or null password is assigned by the "gpasswd" program,
you will still be prompted for a password.

As /root you can edit the /etc/gshadow file and add your login account
to the list of group users.  This allows you to perform the "newgrp"
command without specifying a password - even if the group password is
locked.
