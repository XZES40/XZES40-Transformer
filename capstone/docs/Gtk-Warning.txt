The "gedit" program and the "Gnome-SystemMonitor" program emit lots
of Gtk-WARNINGs that can be ignored.  The Gnome-SystemMonitor becomes
useless. The "gedit" program is still usable.  Our Capstone installation
does not have the Gnome-SystemMonitor installed. 

The following warnings can be ignored when using the gedit program
without having the full GNOME architecture and full XDM display manager
installed.  The XFCE uses lightdm as a lightweight XDM display manager.
You can have only one display manager installed unless you are handling
multiple displays on your system (hardware and system dependencies).

Ignore these errors.

(gedit:1612) Gtk-WARNING **; Calling Inhibit failed:
GDBus.Error:org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.ServiceUnknown:
The name org.gnome.SessionManager was not provided by
any .service files.

Installing the org.gnome.SessionManager does not resolve this issue.

I have seen some experimental proxies for faking the interfaces
for org.gnome.SessionManager for other graphical platforms (i.e. XFCE).
